/*Benjamin is studying polar coordinates and wants to convert them to Cartesian coordinates. Develop a program that takes the radius (r) and angle (Î¸) in degrees as input, converts the angle to radians using inbuilt mathematical functions, and outputs the Cartesian coordinates (x, y).



Formula

radian = angle * pi / 180.0
x = radius * cos(radian) 
y = radius * sin(radian) 


Note: The pi value is calculated using M_PI constant from the math library.

Input format :
The first line consists of a double-value r, representing the radius.

The second line consists of a double-value a, representing the angle in degrees.

Output format :
The output prints two space-separated double values representing the Cartesian coordinates(x, y), both rounded to one decimal place.*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double radius, angle;
    scanf("%lf", &radius);
    scanf("%lf", &angle);

    double radian_angle = angle * M_PI / 180.0;

    double x = radius * cos(radian_angle);
    double y = radius * sin(radian_angle);

    printf("%.1lf %.1lf", x, y);

    return 0;
}
